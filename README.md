This is a ToDo List mobile application build using react-native.


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1:From the root of the project directory: run npm install 
## Step 2 : If you are using iOS, cd ios, run pod install 

Once the dependencies are installed 

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. 
Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
